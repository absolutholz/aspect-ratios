# Front-end Tooling Collection

This repository is a collection of helpful tools that I have found or created over the years. It is not necessarily a boilerplate, but could serve that purpose to some extent. I include it in other projects as a dependency

## Gulp

Gulp functions that can be integrated into custom Gulp tasks as required by the project.

## (S)CSS

Mixins, functions, variables and generated CSS code. Documented via [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com/)

## JavaScript

EcmaScript Modules documented via [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/)
